# Advanced Set-Returning Functions in PostgreSQL 🚀

PostgreSQL provides powerful **Set-Returning Functions** (SRFs) that allow you to return multiple rows from a function. SRFs can be used in `SELECT`, `FROM`, and even in `JOIN` clauses. They are perfect for generating series, unnesting arrays, and expanding JSON data. Let’s explore some amazing examples! 🔍

## 1. `generate_series()` 🧑‍💻

`generate_series()` is one of the most versatile SRFs in PostgreSQL. It generates a series of values, which can be numbers, dates, or timestamps.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT generate_series(1, 5); 
-- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
